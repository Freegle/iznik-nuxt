# iznik-nuxt

Iznik is a platform for online reuse of unwanted items.  This is a work-in-progress rewrite of
the client half.  

The development has been funded by [Freegle](https://www.ilovefreegle.org) for use in the UK, 
but it is an open source platform which can be used or adapted by others.

# Development

You'll need npm (>= v5.5.1) and node (>= 8.9.4).  Then install all the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then start the dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

This will serve up the site at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

It will watch for changes and do hot module reloading.

# Technologies

Briefly:
* [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), which is [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (so we get all 
that nice reactive stuff), with a standard layout and (crucially) a good Server Side 
Rendering solution.
* [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/), which is Bootstrap v4 for Vue/Nuxt. 

# Current Status

This is still very much a proof of concept.
* You can log in using email/password only.
* You'll see a homepage with a list of groups which link to the explore page.
* The My Groups and Chat pages exist.  They are incomplete, and some areas are mockups.
