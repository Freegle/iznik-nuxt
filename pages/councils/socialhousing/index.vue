            Why reuse?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Freegle helps people give and get useful things for free in their local community. Some people have stuff
            they don't want any more. Other people would like things they don't have. Freegle matches them up.
            Reuse has countless environmental, social and financial benefits and helps to create a more circular
            economy.

            Linking to Freegle
          </h2>
          <p>
            Freegle is working with local authorities and other social housing providers to find new ways of signposting
            tenants towards their local Freegle communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            By highlighting Freegle on existing communication channels such as housing management systems, noticeboards,
            newsletters and other correspondence with residents, we can spread the Freegle message to tenants at crucial
            points in their tenancies.

            Bulky Waste & Furniture Poverty
          </h2>
          <p>
            When there isn’t enough money for fuel or food - where does the money for furniture and appliances come
            from?
          </p>
          <p>
            Bulky items like sofas, tables, chairs and mattresses are frequently taken to Household Waste Recycling
            Centres or sent for disposal via bulky waste collection services. Research from WRAP shows that more than
            half of those items could be reused with no or minimal ‘preparation for reuse’ required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2021 'No Place Like Home' report from End Furniture Poverty indicated that social housing tenants, with
            little or no furniture, have to rely on a patchwork of options to acquire it (primarily local authority
            grants, charity grants, discretionary funds, friends and family, social security advances, and moderate to
            high interest lenders). This collage of options, however, appears to be significantly failing to provide
            adequate material support for those most in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find out more about the issues of Bulky Waste and Furniture Poverty and how these affect local
            authorities, check out Freegle's report:

          <p class="quote">
            Millions of families are living in Furniture Poverty across the UK, unable to afford to buy or replace
            essential furniture items, items which local authorities are collecting through bulky household waste
            contracts and then, in many cases, disposing of. If local authorities take good quality, preloved furniture
            out of the waste stream, they can be used to help families in a time of need, and potentially ease pressures
            on other frontline services.

            Freegle - Saving £££s
          </h2>
          <p>
            Local authorities can save significant amounts in disposal costs when they successfully facilitate the
            diversion of bulky waste and other items away from the waste stream and into reuse.
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            Wandsworth Freegle and Richmond-upon-Thames Freegle are two extremely active groups operating across these
            boroughs. Every tonne of bulky waste diverted from disposal by this freegling activity saves between
            £120-160 in disposal costs. Local residents initiated the groups, Freegle set them up and all we had to do
            was link to them on the bulky waste pages of the Councils’ web sites. The local group memberships snowballed
            from there. The tonnages reused over the last 12 months by these two communities combined is 149 tonnes with
            associated disposal cost savings of between £17,880 & £23,840.
