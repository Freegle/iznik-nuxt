            Reducing fly-tipping
          </h3>
          <p>
            Defra statisticians have recently analysed data from WasteDataFlow, Keep Britain Tidy and Freegle and found
            that freegling saved councils &pound;167,910 in costs associated with fly-tipping during 2019.
            You can read the full results and the method statement
            <!-- eslint-disable-next-line -->
            <ExternalLink href="/Freegle_fly_tipping_method_statement.docx">here</ExternalLink>.  So it makes sense
            to encourage your residents to freegle.

          <h3>
            Making Freegle visible on your council websites
          </h3>
          <p>
            A simple and effective way to encourage residents to reuse their waste through Freegle is to provide links on key pages of your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our top recommendations for pages to include links on are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Household Waste Recycling Centres</b> – A reminder that the tip is not the only option for unwanted items!
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bulky waste</b> - Many councils point residents towards Freegle and other reuse organisations on their bulky waste web pages to help reduce the amount of waste disposed of through bulky collections - and reminding residents
              they can save money by using Freegle instead of paying for a bulky waste collection.  Here are some good examples from other councils that you can replicate:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.richmond.gov.uk/book_a_bulky_item_collection" target="_blank">London Borough of Richmond Council</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="http://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/waste/bulky/collection.aspx">Central Bedfordshire Council</a>

                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20009/waste_and_recycling/86/bulky_waste_collections">Birmingham City Council</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Waste reduction</b> – If you provide information about waste minimisation and reuse, include a quick link to your local Freegle group here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>A-Z</b> - If you have an A-Z of waste and recycling, please list Freegle as an option.  Brighton & Hove
              City Council are a great example of how this can be done - see <a href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/environment/recycling-rubbish-and-street-cleaning/recycling-a-z" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oxfordshire County Council have created a <a href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/environment-and-planning/waste-and-recycling/household-waste/repair-reuse-or-recycle" target="_blank">Waste Wizard</a> which directs residents to repair, reuse and recycling options, including pointing people towards Freegle.
              This is a really easy way to let people know about Freegle and other similar organisations that help maximise reuse locally.

          <h3>
            Advice for discussing Freegle with residents
          </h3>
          <p>
            Freegle is an easily accessible service that can be used by anyone and being community based enhances its appeal to residents.  The key points are that Freegle is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Free to join and free to use.</li>
            <li>Everything on Freegle is free.</li>
            <li>It's a convenient way of getting rid of items you no longer need from the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>
              Freegle can help bring communities together – you're helping out someone nearby - either giving them
              something they need, or giving them the gift of free space.  You may find people who share the same
              hobbies and interests as you and you can help out the more vulnerable people in your community.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Talking to residents about bulky waste
          </h3>
          <p>
            Some councils that we work ensure that when taking calls about bulky waste, residents are reminded that it
            may be cheaper and easier for them to try giving away the item using Freegle, other reuse organisations or
            charities.  Providing a 'script' for staff to use is a simple way to do this, but you can also add it to
            the relevant section of your website.  The London Borough of Richmond Council does an excellent job of reminding residents they can save
            money by using Freegle instead of paying for a bulky waste collection - see <a href="https://www.richmond.gov.uk/book_a_bulky_item_collection" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a county council, you can work with your districts and boroughs to ensure that a consistent
            message about bulky waste is promoted throughout the whole county from websites to dealing directly
            with residents.  This is something that Cumbria County Council have done.  We are happy to put you in
            touch with them if you would like to discuss how this has worked in their county.

          <h3>
            Household Waste Recycling Centres - the Freegle alternative
          </h3>
          <p>
            By the time your residents have reached the HWRC it's generally too late for them to reconsider dumping
            their waste; but putting up posters, handing out business cards to site users on arrival at the gate
            or even erecting a banner in a strategic place can prompt residents to think about using Freegle as an
            alternative in future.

          <h3>
            How Freegle can help right across your local authority
          </h3>
          <p>
            Freegle is about community as well as waste.  It’s about helping people in need and bringing people
            together.  Why not encourage other departments in your authority to make use of Freegle too?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Schools</b> – From furniture to musical instruments, stationery to electrical items and uniform.
              Schools generate a lot of waste, some of which is still in a usable condition and could be reused by
              another school or a member of the community.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Housing</b> – Providing cheap furniture and other items to families in need.
              End of tenancy clearances and refurbishments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Estates</b> – When disposing of or acquiring properties, Freegle could come in useful for getting
              rid of surplus/unwanted furniture and other items.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Facilities/caretakers</b> – Generally, Facilities/Caretakers form part of the waste disposal
              chain at a local authority.  Many items can be reused and save the council money and hassle
              rather than disposing of them.

            Christmas toolkit

          <p>
            Christmas is a busy time of year for local authorities.  Arranging collections, organising waste
            prevention events, sending out collection calendars for next year and trying to help residents avoid
            generating what seems to be the inevitable mountain of waste.
          </p>
          <p>
            Freegle are here to help make encouraging your residents to have a less wasteful Christmas a bit
            easier.  We have a range of <a href="/councils/socialmedia#christmas">FREE ready-made templates</a>

            Freegle is a brilliant way of passing on unwanted stuff locally and giving it a new lease of life.
            It’s also a great way of helping families that might be struggling to afford everything at this time of year.

                Christmas trees – giving away unwanted ones or getting a new one

              <li>
                Decorations
              </li>
              <li>
                Toys and other presents (you’ll be amazed what people are giving away)
              </li>
              <li>
                An extra seat for the dining room table!

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            And after the event…

                Regifting unwanted presents (yes, it’s really ok to do that!)
