          <h2>Encouraging resilient communities</h2>

          <p>
            The Sustainability and Resilience Team at Essex County Council, otherwise known as 'Love Essex', are a team
            of ten, working across a range of sustainability projects. These include waste prevention & reuse;
            environmental awareness and an Interreg-funded project called BLUEPRINT to the Circular Economy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Encouraging reuse has long been an integral part of the Love Essex offer. Alongside this, a number of
            community-led, local Freegle groups began to form in the county after Freegle's launch in 2009. The Love Essex
            team were quick to see the financial and social benefits of engaging with Freegle further and in 2016 a
            mutually beneficial partnership between the two was formed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Essex County Council acknowledged the value in supporting residents to build more self-reliant communities through the
            simple act of reuse, an activity which impacts positively on use of resources, saves money and helps to
            protect the environment, aligning neatly with many of the Love Essex priorities.
          </p>

          <h2>Love Essex - a move towards reuse</h2>
          <p>
            The 'Love Essex' brand and website were launched in September 2018, replacing 'Recycle for Essex'.
            The county council and the districts worked together to develop a single brand with a consistent
            message to promote waste reduction, prevention, recycling and reuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            The website is now the county's main hub for all things related to household waste & recycling, recycling
            centres and waste prevention initiatives. Information arrives via the website, a dedicated Facebook page, Twitter, Instagram and a
            monthly e-newsletter for residents. Over 15, 000 residents are current subscribers to the newsletter and
            this multi-channel method of communicating with the public has proved to be very effective.
            Cathryn Wood, Senior Sustainability & Resilience Officer at Essex CC commented:-
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="quote">Our monthly e-newsletter is one of a range of digital communications that we use.
              Use of social media platforms to reach out to residents has become more important, especially in
              the current climate, when face-to-face engagement is not possible and many are spending more time
              in the home. We monitor all our campaigns on a monthly basis using measures such as the
              'open' and 'click' rates to help inform us as to what works most effectively. This digital
              trail, means that engagement can be measured and monitored much more effectively than with more
              traditional communication methods, such as radio ads and print.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Essex's twelve districts, boroughs and cities use the Love Essex website to share news,
            ideas and content derived from this central source through their own channels.

            Cathryn continued:-
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="quote">When planning our media campaigns, an emphasis on reuse and the promotion of Freegle
              makes perfect sense. Reuse is something that virtually every resident can start doing today, without
              having to leave home. There are few barriers, the benefits are obvious and Freegle makes the
              process very easy</span>
          </p>

          <ImageWithCaption src="/councils/casestudies/essex2.png" text="Love Essex regularly uses Facebook to generate posts promoting Freegle and reuse" />

          <h2>Supporting Freegle</h2>

          <p>
            There are currently twenty local Freegle groups across Essex, with almost 70,000 members. In the last
            12 months, 164 tonnes of 'stuff' was reused via the platform, saving an estimated 83.8 tonnes of CO2.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cathryn Wood explained why Essex County Council wanted to support Freegle:-
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="quote">
              Local Freegle groups have been active within the community for several years now and as a local
              authority we felt compelled to support and encourage them. There are some excellent examples of
              reuse already happening within the groups. The fact that residents can pass on a range of useful
              resources such as furniture, clothing or children's toys, means that those in our community who are
              most in need, get to access such items for no cost. For us, supporting a charity such as Freegle is
              also a way of en-couraging resilient communities, especially in these difficult times.  But the
              benefits don't end there. For every tonne of material that is reused, the local authorities reduce
              collection, processing and disposal costs.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2020, Essex CC awarded Freegle sponsorship from the county's Waste Prevention budget. This funding
            helped with the platform's hosting and site maintenance costs in addition to covering some
            of the loss of income that Freegle experienced in 2020, due to a reduction in user donations
            during the Covid-19 crisis. The county have recently committed to continuing this support in 2021.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="quote">
              The local groups with their band of volunteers are completely self sufficient so we don't need to get
              involved with any of the day to day activity
            </span> said Cathryn.
            <span class="quote">
              However it made total sense for us to offer on-going support to Freegle more centrally. Even with a
              small investment, Freegle has the capacity to deliver significant, meaningful and measurable results
              which are of great value to Essex County Council and its residents.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Freegle Founder Edward Hibbert commented:-
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="quote">
              Support from local authorities is crucial for Freegle. Our local groups are community driven and
              largely self-sustaining but with a small input of funding centrally, an incredible amount can be
              achieved. As a charity, Freegle is free to use but not free to run and we rely on donations to
              keep the platform operating. Local authorities have the ability to spread the reuse message far and wide
              and it is simply fantastic to see Essex County Council consistently demonstrating this in innovative
              and engaging ways.

            Collection Vehicle Livery
          </h2>

          <p>
            In late 2019, an opportunity arose to advertise on collection vehicles in Braintree. As the newly founded
            Braintree local Freegle group didn't have many users at this time, the team at Love Essex immediately
            thought that this could be of benefit to Freegle.
          </p>

          <ImageWithCaption src="/councils/casestudies/essex3.png" text="Freegle Livery on Braintree collection vehicle" />

          <p>
            <span class="quote">
              We wanted to promote the group in this area to encourage more people to use the platform and
              increase donations
            </span> said Cathryn.
            <span class="quote">
              The estimated reach of the collection vehicle livery is 65,000 households on a weekly basis.
            </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            Over time, Freegle membership across the county has steadily grown, as the graph below, showing statistics
            from a two-year period Jan '19 to Dec '20 demonstrates. Tonnage of materials reused has also increased
            significantly over this time with a clear resurgence of reuse activity after May 2020 when Freegle
            groups were unable to operate for a short time due to the Covid pandemic.

            In addition to the online activity, Freegle artwork and information has been included in magazines,
            newspaper adverts and on bookmarks sent to libraries. Radio campaigns are also used from time to time.
