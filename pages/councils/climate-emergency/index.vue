            Cllr Dave Brookes, Cabinet Member for Environment, Lancaster City Council said:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            Every local authority should make time to chat to Freegle. In order to deliver a meaningful and collective response to the climate emergency, it is essential that councils start to engage more with outside organisations
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            Sponsoring and promoting local Freegle groups is an inexpensive, quick win to boost your council's reuse credentials and get residents engaged.

            I received this beautiful sofa from a lovely gentleman who had it in his garage. It used to be his mums and he had no use for it. He listed it on here and I am so pleased it is exactly what I was looking for. I love to have second hand stuff that is totally useable and often better quality than I could afford new.”

            Freegle makes the hassle of restarting my life just a bit easier.

          <p class="quote">
            "When I was a teenager I used to go the the tipping sites and recover stuff. I even learnt electronics so I could fix TV's and radios I found. Most of the time they just needed a fuse that would back then cost a few pennies. I love the new drive and volume of people trying to reduce the waste we produce, the restarters, recyclers, self producers, crafters, up-cyclers, the more the better for us all and nature. But right now its more poignant because after being homeless for a long while I've just got a home again, and being able to collect the things I need just makes the hassle of restarting my life just a bit easier."
