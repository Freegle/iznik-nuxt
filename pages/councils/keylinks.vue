            Links to Freegle communities
          </h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore" target="_blank">
              https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore</a> - Use this link to find your local Freegle group, then add the
            links to your website.  For example, if you search for York, you can select the York Freegle group
            <a href="https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/York-Freegle" target="_blank">https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/York-Freegle</a>.

          <h3>Shortlinks</h3>
          <p>
            Shortlinks can help make your publicity easier.  They are short website addresses which redirect to
            longer ones. They are easier for potential members to remember and type than a long URL and are
            more practical for including on websites, posters, leaflets etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Freegle community has a shortlink, and you can create your own trackable shortlinks to
            help you monitor activity.  Please go to the <nuxt-link to="/shortlinks">
              Shortlinks
            </nuxt-link> page for more info.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example shortlink would be <a href="https://freegle.in/croydon">freegle.in/croydon</a> which redirects to
            <a href="https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/Croydon-Freegle">https://www.ilovefreegle.org/explore/Croydon-Freegle</a>.

          <h3>
            Live Statistics
          </h3>
          <p>
            On each Freegle communityâ€™s page you can view live statistics for that particular community
            (the example below is for <a href="https://www.ilovefreegle.org/stats/York-Freegle">https://www.ilovefreegle.org/stats/York-Freegle</a>).
            We also use WRAP's Benefits of Reuse tool to generate CO2 and cost savings data.

            Heatmap
          </h3>
          <p>
            We are currently developing a heatmap, which will enable you to better direct your communications by
            showing you where and how much Freegle activity is taking place in a given area (see example below).  You can
            find this at <a href="https://www.ilovefreegle.org/stats/heatmap">https://www.ilovefreegle.org/stats/heatmap</a>.
