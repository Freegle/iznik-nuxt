          <p>Thank you!  It's nice of you to even think about supporting us.</p>

            We provide a free service and keep costs low thanks to our
            large number of committed volunteers - but there are some things we have to pay for to keep going.

            Freegle is relatively unusual, especially in the charity world. Most websites host read-only
            content which changes quite rarely, for a relatively small number of active users. We have an active
            service where there are changes happening continuously, and we send out hundreds of thousands of emails
            a day. You can certainly get a cheap and cheerful charity website that doesn’t do much for a few quid a
            year, but you can’t run something like Freegle that way.  It’s a different kettle of fish.
            It’s not even a kettle, and they’re not fish.
