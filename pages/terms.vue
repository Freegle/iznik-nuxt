        We could give you a ten page long Terms of Use.  Like you'd read that.

        As far as we're concerned, it's simple:
      </p>
      <ol class="">
        <li>Use Freegle to pass on unwanted items direct to others.</li>
        <li>Everything must be free and legal.</li>
        <li>Be nice to other freeglers, and they'll be nice to you.</li>
        <li>
