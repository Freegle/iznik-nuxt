      We could give you a ten page long Terms of Use.  Like you'd read that.

    <p>
      As far as we're concerned, it's simple:
    </p>
    <ol class="">
      <li>Use Freegle to pass on unwanted items direct to others.  No sales, no swaps, just simple gifts.</li>
      <li>Everything must be free and legal.</li>
      <li>Be nice to other freeglers, and they'll be nice to you.</li>
      <li>
        <!-- eslint-disable-next-line-->
        We don't see or check items offered - see our <nuxt-link to="/disclaimer">disclaimer</nuxt-link>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Freegle communities may have additional rules.  If you have questions, scroll down and use the
        <em>Contact community volunteers</em> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <!-- eslint-disable-next-line-->

      </li>
      <li>Objectionable content or behaviour will not be tolerated.</li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>You must be aged 13 or over, as there is user-generated content.</li>
