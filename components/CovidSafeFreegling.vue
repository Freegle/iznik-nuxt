      Freegle is particularly useful right now, as some people will be particularly in need.  So do please post OFFERs
      and also keep an eye on WANTEDs in case you can help out.  But we do not want to encourage unnecessary travel and
      we'd like
      everyone to stay safe - please
      <b>READ</b> and <b>FOLLOW</b> these updated COVID-19 guidelines for freegling.
    </p>
    <h4>Keep it LOCAL</h4>
    <p>
      Avoid special or extra journeys for freegling - see Government advice in

      You must comply with restrictions on travel and use of public transport.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must post only to your nearest community, and please do not reply to posts further away.
    </p>
    <h4>PROTECT each other</h4>
    <p>
      If you have recently had COVID-19, please don't use Freegle for at least 10 days after you are free of symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure anything you offer is clean.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wash fabric things.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe down hard surfaces with hot soapy water.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Assume anything you collect <b>isn't</b> clean (better safe than sorry).  Clean it yourself, and if possible
      leave it for a few days before touching it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wear a face covering unless medically exempt, and sanitise your hands afterwards.
    </p>
    <h4>SOCIAL DISTANCING</h4>
    <p>
      Observe SOCIAL-DISTANCING and make CONTACT-LESS arrangements for collections.  Do not enter anyone else's home
      or let them enter yours.  This might mean holding off listing bulky items that need a few people to move!
    </p>
    <h4>COVID-vulnerable?</h4>
    <p>
      As much as we'd like everyone to benefit from freegling, if you are COVID-vulnerable please do not freegle
      and exchange goods (though you're welcome to ask for help with supplies via our
      <nuxt-link to="/chitchat">
        ChitChat
      </nuxt-link> section).
    </p>
    <h4>And finally...</h4>
    <p>
      As always be kind, polite and don't waste anyone's time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay safe everyone!
    </p>
