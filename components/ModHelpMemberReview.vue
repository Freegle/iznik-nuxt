      We have some automated checks that spot unusual member behaviour.  Sometimes these will be people who are
      spammers/scammers, sometimes they may be overenthusiastic members who need a bit of guidance, and sometimes
      they may just be perfectly good members who just happen to be caught in the net.
    </p>

      Please review their posting history and logs.

    <p>
      You may or may not want to do something about them on your group:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you do, click the link to go to their membership on your group.
      </li>
      <li>
        From there you can remove them, ban them, send them a message, whatever.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can add a Mod Note to show other mods what you've decided or done.
      </li>
      <li>
        At some point you may be able to do some of that from here - but not yet.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Otherwise, click the button to <em>Ignore on</em> your group.  They'll only show up again if something
      has changed which makes them look unusual again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you think they are a spammer/scammer, click the <em>Spammer</em> button to report them.
